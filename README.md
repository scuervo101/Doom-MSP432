# A light Doom/Wolf3d 3D demo

**This Repo is uncomplete**

Using the completed G8RTOS we creating during our MicroP 2 class, we are able to generate a 3D environment similar to early doom and wolf3d. This was accomplished using the [wolf3d repo](https://github.com/id-Software/wolf3d/tree/master/WOLFSRC) and converting it to c and embedded capable code.

## To Test the Project

This project was created using the msp432 and a accompaning mother board with a touch screen lcd and a joystick and buttons.

Repo was created by [Nathan Andreo](https://github.com/nandreo33) and myself, [Samuel Cuervo](https://github.com/scuervo101)
